# Web-Data-Based-Conversational-Agent

Welcome to the Web Data Based Conversational Agent repository! This project aims to create a conversational agent that leverages web data to enhance interactions and provide valuable information. The agent uses web scraping and natural language processing (NLP) to deliver contextually relevant responses based on the latest web content.

Features:
1-Real-Time Data Retrieval: Fetches and processes real-time web data to provide up-to-date responses.
2-Natural Language Understanding: Utilizes advanced NLP techniques to understand and generate human-like responses.
3-Contextual Awareness: Maintains context over the course of a conversation to deliver coherent interactions.
4-Customizable Web Sources: Allows configuration of various web sources for tailored responses.
